### Introduction
This project focuses on digit recognition from images using a two-stage approach. The first stage predicts bounding boxes and classifies each digit, while the second stage combines the detected digits to form the final numeric prediction. To achieve this, I use a pre-trained Faster R-CNN model with a ResNet-50 backbone, which is fine-tuned to support 11-class classification.
